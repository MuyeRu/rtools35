                             Rtools 3.5

This bundle contains the Windows Toolchain and Build Utilities for R.
The original collection was put together by Prof. Brian Ripley and 
Duncan Murdoch; it is currently maintained by Jeroen Ooms.

                             TOOLCHAINS

The same toolchain is used for building R itself and compiling R
packages from source. Versions 3.3, 3.4, and 3.5 of Rtools ship with 
a mingw-w64 toolchain based on gcc 4.9.3. We do not use multilib
compilers, instead we ship separate compilers targeting 32 and 64 bit.

If you install Rtools anywhere other than the default C:\Rtools\, you
have to point R to the path of gcc, g++, ld, etc, by setting a variable
called BINPREF. For example:

  BINPREF="M:/R/Rtools-3.5/mingw_$(WIN)/bin/"

Note how we embed another variable $(WIN) which is set by R to either 
"32" or "64" depending on the target. Thereby this BINPREF works for 
both architectures.

I do not recommended to store this variable in your Windows system but
instead define it in your .Renviron file in your user home path, which
is your Documents folder. See also ?Startup in R.

                           BUILD UTILITIES

Rtools includes some standard utilities such as make, bash, sed, which 
are required to build R packages with compiled code. These utilities
need to be on the PATH when installing R packages from source. 

Again, I do not recommended to modify your Windows system PATH, instead
add a line like this in the same .Renviron file discussed above:

  PATH="C:\Rtools\bin;${PATH}"

You can skip this step if your PATH already has working versions of sh,
and make, for example from CYGWIN or msys2. There is nothing special 
about our versions, almost any version will do. However this does not
hold for the toolchain; be very careful with 3rd party gcc, g++, ld on 
the system PATH.
